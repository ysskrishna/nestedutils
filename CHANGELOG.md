## [1.0.0]

### Added

- Initial release of nestedutils
- `get_path()` function for accessing nested values in dictionaries, lists, and tuples
- `set_path()` function for setting nested values with automatic container creation
- `del_path()` function for deleting nested values
- Support for dot-notation string paths (`"a.b.c"`) and list paths (`["a", "b", "c"]`)
- List index support with positive and negative indices
- Multiple fill strategies for `set_path()`:
  - `"auto"`: Intelligently creates containers based on next key type
  - `"none"`: Fills missing list items with `None`
  - `"dict"`: Always creates dictionaries
  - `"list"`: Always creates lists
- Comprehensive error handling with `PathError` exception and `PathErrorCode` enum
- Support for navigating through `None` values (replaces with appropriate containers)
- Sparse list creation when setting values at high indices
- Full test coverage with comprehensive test suite

### Features

- Zero external dependencies
- Python 3.7+ compatibility
- Immutable container protection (tuples cannot be modified)
- Safe list deletion (requires explicit `allow_list_mutation=True` flag)
